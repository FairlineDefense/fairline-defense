        <h3>21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction </h3>
        <P>
          You agree that the Terms of Service (and incorporated Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy) are governed and 
          interpreted by the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to principles of conflicts of law. By using 
          our Services, you agree to personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of Minnesota 
          in order to resolve any dispute arising from your use of the Services, including but not limited to the 
          enforcement of any arbitration award. You further agree to waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.

        <h3>22. Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Class Remedies </h3>
        <P>
          (a) Arbitration Agreement
        </P>
        <P>
          Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service shall be finally resolved by binding 
          arbitration following the parties’ best efforts to settle such dispute, claim, question or disagreement. If a 
          binding arbitration occurs, it shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its 
          Commercial Arbitration Rules and its procedures for consumer disputes, except for any rules or procedures 
          permitting class actions or otherwise contradictory to the Terms of Service. An arbitrator shall wield exclusive 
          authority to resolve all disputes, including whether this or any other provision contained in the Terms of 
          Service is void or voidable. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and entered as a judgment in any court of 
          competent jurisdiction and in accordance with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction clause of the Terms of Service.
        </P>
        <P>
          The parties understand that, absent this Arbitration Agreement provision, they may otherwise have the right to 
          sue in a court of law and may have the right to a trial by jury. While arbitration is intended to be more cost-
          effective, in some instances the cost of arbitration may exceed the cost of civil litigation in a court. Moreover, 
          the rules and procedures of arbitration may limit discovery.
        </P>
        <P>
          (b) Waiver of Class Remedies
        </P>
        <P>
          The parties agree that any arbitration shall be conducted only in their individual entity capacities, and the 
          parties expressly forego the right or option to file or join a class action or other representative action. 
          Should any court or arbitrator determine that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or 
          otherwise unenforceable, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision 
          shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate any dispute.
        </P>
        <P>
          (c) Exception: Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims
        </P>
        <P>
          Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, relief may also be sought in 
          a small claims court for disputes or claims within that court’s jurisdiction—subject to the Governing Law and 
          Jurisdiction clause of the Terms of Service.
        </P>
        <P>
          (d) Thirty Day Right to Opt-Out
        </P>
        <P>
          You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action provisions of this 
          section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Fairline Defense Customer Service at our registered 
          business address. Such notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use our Services, or else you s
          hall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms of Service. Any such opt out shall be mutual. We 
          reserve the right to terminate your use of our Services should you opt out.
